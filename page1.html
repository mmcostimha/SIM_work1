        <h2>Why Should I Study Information Systems?</h2>
        <p>
            You are part of the most connected generation in history: You have grown up online; you are,quite literally,
            never out of touch; you use more information technologies (in the form of digital devices), for more tasks,
            and are bombarded with more information, than any generation in history. The MIT Technology Review refers to
            you as Homo conexus. Information technologies are so deeply embedded in your lives that your daily routines
            would be almost unrecognizable to a college student just 20 years ago.
        </p>
        <p class="idented">
            Essentially, you practice continuous computing, surrounded by a movable information network. This network is
            created by constant cooperation between the digital devices you carry(e.g., laptops, media players, and
            smartphones); the wired and wireless networks that you access as you move about; and Web-based tools for fi
            nding information and communicating and collaborating with other people. Your network enables you to pull
            information about virtually anything from anywhere, at any time, and to push your own ideas back to the Web,
            from wherever you are, via a mobile device. Think of everything you do online, often with your smart phone:
            register for classes; take classes (and not just at your university); access class syllabi, information,
            PowerPoints, and lectures; research class papers and presentations; conduct banking; pay your bills;
            research, shop, and buy products from companies or other people; sell your “stuff”;
            search for, and apply for, jobs; make your travel reservations (hotel, airline, rental
            car); create your own blog and post your own podcasts and videocasts to it; design your own
            page on Facebook; make and upload videos to YouTube; take, edit, and print your own digital
            photographs; “burn” your own custom-music CDs and DVDs; use RSS feeds to create your
            personal electronic newspaper; text and tweet your friends and family throughout your day; and
            many other activities. (Note: If any of these terms are unfamiliar to you, don’t worry. You will
            learn about everything mentioned here in detail later in this text.)
        </p>

        <h3>The Informed User—You!</h3>
        <p>
            So, the question is: Why you should learn about information systems and information technologies? After all,
            you can comfortably use a computer (or other electronic devices) to perform
            many activities, you have been surfi ng the Web for years, and you feel confi dent that you can
            manage any IT application that your organization’s MIS department installs.
            The answer lies in your becoming an informed user; that is, a person knowledgeable about
            information systems and information technology. There are several reasons why you should be
            an informed user.
            In general, informed users tend to get more value from whatever technologies they use. You
            will enjoy many benefi ts from being an informed user of IT.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>First, you will benefi t more from your organization’s IT applications because you will
                understand what is “behind” those applications (see <a href="#Figure1.1">Figure 1.1</a>). That is, what you see
                on your computer screen is brought to you by your MIS department, who are operating
                “behind” your screen.</li>
            <li>Second, you will be in a position to enhance the quality of your organization’s IT applications with
                your
                input.</li>
            <li>Third, even as a new graduate, you will quickly be in a position to recommend—and perhaps help
                select—the
                IT applications that your organization will use.</li>
            <li>Fourth, being an informed user will keep you abreast of both new information technologies and rapid
                developments in existing technologies. Remaining “on top of things” will
                help you to anticipate the impacts that “new and improved” technologies will have on your
                organization and to make recommendations on the adoption and use of these technologies.</li>
            <li>Fifth, you will understand how using IT can improve your organization’s performance and
                teamwork as well as your own productivity.</li>
            <li>Finally, if you have ideas of becoming an entrepreneur, then being an informed user will
                help you use IT when you start your own business.
                Going further, managing the IS function within an organization is no longer the exclusive responsibility
                of
                the IS department. Rather, users now play key roles in every step of this
                process. The overall objective in this text is to provide you with the necessary information to
                contribute immediately to managing the IS function in your organization. In short, the goal is
                to help you become a very informed user!</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>IT Offers Career Opportunities</h3>
        <img src="Captura de ecrã 2024-09-16 094923.png" alt="IT Offers Career Opportunities image"
            class="centred_picture" id="Figure1.1">
        <p>Because information technology is vital to the operation of modern businesses, it offers many
            employment opportunities. The demand for traditional IT staff—programmers, business 10 CHAPTER 1
            Introduction to Information Systems
            analysts, systems analysts, and designers—is substantial. In addition, many well-paid jobs exist
            in areas such as the Internet and electronic commerce (e-commerce), mobile commerce
            (m-commerce), network security, telecommunications, and multimedia design.
            The information systems field includes the people in various organizations who design and
            build information systems, the people who use those systems, and the people responsible for
            managing those systems. At the top of the list is the chief information offi cer (CIO).
            The CIO is the executive who is in charge of the IS function. In most modern organizations, the CIO works
            with the chief executive officer (CEO), the chief fi nancial offi cer
            (CFO), and other senior executives. Therefore, he or she actively participates in the organization’s
            strategic planning process. In today’s digital environment, the IS function has become
            increasingly strategic within organizations. As a result, although most CIOs still rise from the
            IS department, a growing number are coming up through the ranks in the business units (e.g.,
            marketing, finance, etc.). So, regardless of your major, you could become the CIO of your
            organization one day. This is another reason to be an informed user of information systems!
            Table 1.1 provides a list of IT jobs, along with a description of each one. For further details
            about careers in IT, see www.computerworld.com/careertopics/careers and www.monster.com.
            Career opportunities in IS are strong and are projected to remain strong over the next
            ten years. In fact, the U.S. News & World Report and Money magazines listed their “100 top
            jobs” for 2012, and Forbes magazine listed its “10 top jobs” for 2013. Let’s take a look at these
            rankings. (Note that the rankings differ because the magazines used different criteria in their
            research.) As you can see, jobs suited for MIS majors rank extremely high in all three lists. The
            magazines with their job rankings are:

        <h2>Overview of Computer-Based Information Systems</h2>
        <p>Organizations refer to their management information systems functional area by several names,
            including the MIS Department, the Information Systems (IS) Department, the Information
            Technology Department, and the Information Services Department. Regardless of the name,
            however, this functional area deals with the planning for—and the development, management, and use
            of—information technology tools to help people perform all the tasks related
            to information processing and management. Recall that information technology relates to any
            computer-based tool that people use to work with information and to support the information
            and information processing needs of an organization.</p>
        <p>As previously stated, an information system collects, processes, stores, analyzes, and disseminates
            information for a specifi c purpose. The purpose of information systems has been defi ned
            as getting the right information to the right people, at the right time, in the right amount, and
            in the right format. Because information systems are intended to supply useful information, we
            need to differentiate between information and two closely related terms: data and knowledge
            (see Figure 1.2).</p>
        <p> <strong>Data items</strong> refer to an elementary description of things, events, activities, and
            transactions
            that are recorded, classifi ed, and stored but are not organized to convey any specifi c meaning.
            Data items can be numbers, letters, fi gures, sounds, and images. Examples of data items are collections of
            numbers (e.g., 3.11, 2.96, 3.95, 1.99, 2.08) and characters (e.g., B, A, C, A, B, D, F, C).
        </p>
        <p><strong>Information</strong>refers to data that have been organized so that they have meaning and value to
            the recipient. For example, a grade point average (GPA) by itself is data, but a student’s name coupled with
            his or her GPA is information. The recipient interprets the meaning and draws
            conclusions and implications from the information. Consider the examples of data provided in
            the preceding paragraph. Within the context of a university, the numbers could be grade point
            averages, and the letters could be grades in an Introduction to MIS class.</p>
        <p><strong>Knowledge</strong>consists of data and/or information that have been organized and processed
            to convey understanding, experience, accumulated learning, and expertise as they apply to
            a current business problem. For example, suppose that a company recruiting at your school
            has found over time that students with grade point averages over 3.0 have experienced the
            greatest success in its management program. Based on this accumulated knowledge, that
            company may decide to interview only those students with GPAs over 3.0. This example
            presents an example of knowledge because the company utilizes information—GPAs—to
            address a business problem—hiring successful employees. As you can see from this example,
            organizational knowledge, which refl ects the experience and expertise of many people, has
            great value to all employees.</p>
